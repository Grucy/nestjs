# @nestjs-plus/common

Utility functions and low level reusable modules that provide building blocks for the @nestjs-plus and @nestjs ecosystem.

## Discovery

A common Nest pattern which is enabled through `Decorators` is the ability to discover all the components in an application that meet some kind of criteria.

## Mixins

The mixin pattern is particularly useful with NestJS components like `Interceptors` as a mechanism to provide both configuration while still allowing the component to participate with Nest's `Dependency Injection`.
